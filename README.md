# RoomProject
A simple apartment scene that used Unreal Engine 4 to create it. 

## Getting Started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
To get started on this project is quite simple; all you need is an UE4 engine with the latest version, to avoid incompatibility error. On mine machine, the engine is [v4.17.2].
